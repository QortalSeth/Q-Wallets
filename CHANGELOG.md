# Changelog

All notable changes to Q-Wallets will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Redesigned the wallet hub as a full visual and UX overhaul, replacing the older boxed layout with a cinematic coin-led workspace, atmospheric backgrounds, refreshed wallet tabs, and a cleaner right-side Address Book panel.
- Unified the QORT, BTC, LTC, DOGE, DGB, RVN, and ARRR wallet pages around the same shared workspace structure.
- Reworked send dialogs so transfers are easier to understand and harder to misread, with recipient-first layouts, cleaner amount fields, better Max/fee placement, clearer loading states while recipient data is being confirmed, and a smoother send-to-contact flow.
- Modernized the Address Book into a more usable wallet companion, with easier add/edit/delete flows, QORT name search when creating contacts, duplicate-contact warnings, explicit address confirmation before saving, softer row styling, lighter table text, pastel avatars, improved search styling, and better sync feedback.
- Refined transaction tables with lighter headers, improved pagination options, exact dates after 24 hours, smoother row hover feedback, and fewer layout jumps.
- Stabilized Receive QR layout inside Qortal Hub so the right rail can open naturally without making the background atmosphere shift.
- Reduced unnecessary automatic QORT balance refreshes from every 1 minute to every 2.5 minutes while keeping manual refresh available.

### Added

- Receive QR dialogs now work consistently for every wallet, not only QORT.
- QORT Address Book name search now marks results that are already saved with an "already in list" label.
- Save protection now warns users when they try to add a contact before confirming the address.
- Address Book sync now recognizes when local contacts are returned to the last synced state.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- `calculateMaxSendable` utility that computes the "SEND MAX" amount in integer satoshi math and holds back a small safety buffer, avoiding floating-point boundary errors that triggered false "Insufficient funds" rejections from the host
- `SEND_MAX_SAFETY_BUFFER_SATS` constant (1000 sats) used as the SEND MAX safety margin

### Fixed

- BTC and DGB Bech32 address validation: corrected the regex charset to the bech32 alphabet (excludes `1`, `b`, `i`, `o`) and allowed variable address length (39–59 chars) so longer Bech32 addresses (e.g. P2WSH) validate correctly
- SEND MAX no longer prefills an amount that lands on or just above the spendable cutoff

### Changed

- All coin send pages (ARRR, BTC, DGB, DOGE, LTC, QORT, RVN) refactored to use the shared `calculateMaxSendable` utility

### Tests

- Added tests for `calculateMaxSendable`
- Expanded address validation tests covering BTC/DGB Bech32 charset and length cases

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- QDN address book check: added `coinType` field to published QDN resources and dual validation in `fetchFromQDN` to discard resources returned by the Qortal node for a different coin identifier. Primary check uses the new top-level `coinType` field; secondary check uses entries' `coinType` field for backward compatibility with older published resources.
- TypeScript build errors for MUI v7 compatibility: replaced removed named exports (`SlideProps`, `TooltipProps`, `TransitionProps`, `SnackbarCloseReason`, `ToggleButtonGroupProps`) with `ComponentProps<typeof ...>` equivalents or local type definitions; added explicit `Theme` typing to `styled()` callbacks.
- `NumericFormat` forwarded MUI props no longer cause TypeScript errors.

### Tests

- Added 4 tests covering the QDN coinType mismatch scenario.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- QDN address book sync: skip unnecessary publish when timestamps diverge but content is identical (hash comparison before publishing)
- QDN address book sync: re-align local timestamp to QDN after skipping publish, and sync forward after publishing, to avoid redundant evaluations on next startup

### Changed

- Release workflow now fails with a clear message if the release version already exists, instead of silently deleting it
- Removed push trigger from npm tests workflow

### Tests
